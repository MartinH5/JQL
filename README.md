General part

•	Describe how you have handled persistence in the last three semesters.

In the first semester we started out initially by not handling persistence at all. Nothing was saved and programs ran from clean slate every time we started them up. Then we were introduced to text files and input and output writers. These allowed us to open and write to files on our hard disks locally as well as read from them. This allowed the persistence of data on the most primitive level. On the second semester we were introduced to MySQL databases. These allowed us to transform entity classes in Java domain into data that could be stored in tables in database domain. We could now persist data in tables in databases using SQL queries. Finally, on the third semester we expand on the method from the 2nd semester working with ORM and JPA. These allow us to stay in the Java domain and have the SQL queries to and from a SQL database happen in the background for us not having to write any SQL ourselves. 
When working with HTTP and browsers we were able to “fake” state in an otherwise stateless protocol with the use of cookies and headers. Headers contained data in its body such as login authentication for instance. Cookies are similar to text files and contain 
data about the user again such as login information. 

•	Discuss how we usually have queried a relational database

It was done by creating a connector object to connect to our database that used the JDBC driver. It took parameters such as path, url, user, password. Whenever we then wanted to read or write a query we made use of our three-layer model, more specifically our facades, which prepared a statement for instance and then sent it to the database using the connection we had. Database side we then executed that SQL-syntax-query for the desired effect.

•	Explain the Pros & Cons in using an Object Relational Mapping Framework

Pros

We already touched a little on the pros of using ORM and JPA in the previous section. One pro is that we as programmers can work only in the Object-oriented domain (in Java) and not worry or care about the SQL at all. We reap the benefits of only working OO in Java. 
Furthermore, we heavily reduce the amount of coded that we now need to write because frameworks like JPA give us several prebuild tools to use. 
Working with ORM and JPA also means that we have the option to use concurrency. 
Thanks to our entity manager factories and managers, all access to and from the database is handled in transactions that obey the 
principles of ACID. We do not need to enforce this manually. 

Cons

The structure of all the things persisted to the database can be messy. We can end up with duplicate entries, null entries (based on our strategy with inheritance for instance) and normalization is difficult. 
Every time you add a new layer of abstraction that tries to provide a generalized implementation of something that you used to do by hand there is going to be some loss of performance/efficiency.
When we are working exclusively object-oriented which I an advantage for the developer, it means that it is automatically a disadvantage on the end of the database, which doesn’t operate in the same domain. As a result, we lose performance efficiency which is proportional with how much we scale up. Think for instance 100.000 users and the queries that we have to do. 

•	Elaborate on some of the problems a ORM tries to solve

At a very high level: ORMs help to reduce the Object-Relational impedance mismatch. They allow you to store and retrieve full live objects from a relational database without doing a lot of parsing/serialization yourself.
When working with databases the developer has to write a lot of boilerplate-code. ORM attempts to reduce this amount, which makes it easier for the developer, or rather helps him by allowing him to write less code and faster. 
Lastly the goal of using ORM can be summarized as the attempt at mapping objects from the OO world into tables in a relational 
database and provide a runtime mechanism for keeping an in-memory graph of objects and a set of database tables in sync

• Discuss the methods we can use to query a JPA design and compare with what you explained above

The design we use for queries involves many components as seen in the following diagram:  
The purpose of JPA is to give us the ability to work with our data in an object-oriented way. To do so we have several persistent classes and one that isn’t which represent our entities. An entity represents a row in a table from the database. That entity can be handled by its manager which prepares our queries using the appropriate setter and getters from our entities. Unlike the SQL queries used with a connector, these are transactions that follow the principle of ACID. These methods belong to the entity manager are some of them are: persist(), find(), getTransaction().begin() and getTransaction().close(). 
Persist persists our data, which mean it gets saved to our database. Find is a lookup operation and selects data from our database based on a parameter key. The begin and close methods are used to manage our transactions. 

# JQL


* How did we use persistence in the last semesters?

Text files + input/output writers.
MySQL database.

* How we queried to a relational database.

We used a connector object w. a JDBC driver to connect to the database.

* Pros Cons with ORM framework.

It makes it easier to focus on the Object Orieneted programming, rather than having to fiddly with the sql syntax, 
JPA also adds a lot of tools that make the mapping easier with their prebuild tools. 

The generated tables can end up rather unorganized - the structure wouldn't usually be ideal basically. 
It also requires extra resources, whenever the database changes/grows, which probably becomes a huge issue
if it's database service for thousands for users.
